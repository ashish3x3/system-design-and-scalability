Dropbox :
10's of million of user
100s of millions of file syncs per day

challenges:
1. Write Volume : read to write volume
most web application has higer read ot write ratio simply bcz people consume more than they poreduce contents..twitter has sothing 100:1 or 1000:1 tweet read vs twitted
IN dropbox: everyone computer has a complete copy of their entire dropbox... this means we ahve multi peta byte cache memory sitting in front of our service..
so normal cache concept is out of window bcz we are mesuring cache in term of peta byte of memory
so our read to write is roughly 1:1 if U see in terms of uploadind files vs downloading files in client system
we do more weites than read 




2.Atomicity : it has to be all synced or no synced..
for ex lets say U deeted a folder and share it with other people, and U find that the deleted folder is still there.. we cannot be wrong in such situation
Atmomicity: it has to be all synced or no synced..
concsostency : its possible u r updateinfiles to sme dropbox from multiple cmputers..
isolotion : online and offline consostency..
durability : it is must to store the data in comrrect format everytime..

As a whole combination of both of high cnsistency requirements and very high write ratios is oneof the hard problem in distributed systems..this is core to our services..




HIgh level architecture:

clinet(computer) ---> server... 

1st probelm: later server run out of disk space so  data gets huge so decided to put in amazon(AWS) S3 and 2nd was server gets over loaded.. so put mysql instance to separate instance os that it can run on separate hardware..DB..


2nd problem: capacity on server run out.. to an extent that downloading the fil e will push people out of the being able to acccess site..
so they want to separet the uploading and downlaoing feature from all these website and syncing functionlty so that they would not interfer with each other..

3rd problem : clinet were hitting the server directly everytime with polling to check fr update to be synced.. but polling os not such a great option as it increas the load on server..

so server were splitted in 2..
a) meta server : managed hosting ..managing all metadata calls..all logic for DB queries..
b:  block server: in AWS..all file conctent and accepting all uploads..idea is to make RPC call through block server using meta server..
c) not server: notification server wihch send signlas to clietns..



How using mem cahce is difficult when dealing with high consostency
normal scenario is when one memcahc serer is down ,it uses another..but in case of consistency it creates a problem, then what if one server is thinging memcache is down and another think its p, it will update difrent cache when they actully should be working on one..



Problem with load balancer:
created in python, and you can run one thread at time..no parallism.. for each server there can be only one request from server.. one IO and other doning another thing is ok but not two IO parally in pyton..
problem with using multiple load balancer also adds complexity.. 
now we use two load balancer per LB one ofr primary and anothr its backup..so we ended up using tiwcemnay LB than normally..


Problem with simgle DB:
we have to shard it in diff machine..
in sharding many things that work in normakl DB happens fails,,like joins, queries, transactions.


shared folder are difficul to shard.. bca its too many quereis from both end like shared table wnats to know the associated users and associated user wants to know the fiel in shared folder... and this query has to be right every time..son sharding is not so obvious choice...currently not sharded..
