2^31 = Ox 7FFFFFFF

N bit system will rep 2^n-1 to 2^n-1 -1




2^10 = KB
2^20 = MB
2^30 = GB
2^40 = TB

Given that each bit is capable of holding two possible values, the number of possible different combinations
of values that can be stored in n bits is 2^n
. For example

8 bits can hold 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 2^8
 = 256 possible values 


Text(40) consumes 40 bytes. 
A whole number from –128 to +127. 

8 bytes = 64 bits: 
Really massive whole numbers (in the range of + or – 9 quintillion). 
Date/Time
 Currency. 



Early character sets (containing 26 capital letters, 10 numbers, a space character, and assorted
punctuation) allowed 64 characters. A popular example is “ASCII 64”. These sets require 6 bits per
character. Because of the need to include punctuation and/or special symbols in the character set, 6-bit
character sets cannot differentiate between small and capital letters, and are now virtually unused. 

2^ 6 = 64..so we need 6 bits for each

Current western character sets contain either 128 or 256 characters, requiring either 7 or 8 bits per
character. Each is typically stored in one byte (even if only 7 bits are used). 



Some Asian character sets have space for as many as 64K characters, requiring up to 16 bits per
character.
